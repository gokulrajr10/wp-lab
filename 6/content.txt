Algorithm:

1) Start the program.
2) Create an HTML file with buttons for list and grid views, along with content containers for each view.
3) Style buttons, content containers, and layout using CSS.
4) Using JavaScript implement functions to switch between list and grid views, add event listeners to buttons for toggling, and apply an "active" class for the active view.
5) Set the default view to grid when the page loads.
6) Allow users to switch between views by clicking buttons, visually indicating the active view.
7) Stop the program.
